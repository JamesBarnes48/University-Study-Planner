                <module moduleName = "Analogue &amp; Digital" moduleCode = "CMP-5027A" moduleDescription = "A practical introduction to electronics, this module is structured to consider analogue electronics and digital electronics in turn. Topics you’ll cover include passive and active components, including op-amps, transistors, logic gates, flip-flops and registers. Circuits you’ll study include amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, combinational and sequential logic and state machines. You’ll spend much of your time doing practical work – underpinned by lectures – where you will build prototypes circuits, as well as designing and building Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).">

                        <description>The aim of this assignment is to design, implement and evaluate a VoIP communication system to operate between two PCs in the Lewin Lab. The assignment is to be tackled in pairs – typically with one person responsible for the sender and the other for the receiver. This brings in issues such as the standardisation of VoIP packets
